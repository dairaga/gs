# GoScala (gs)

GoScala (gs) imitates Scala Either, Try, Option, Sequence (slice), Map (map), and provides monadic functions.
Go 1.18 does not support type parameters in method, and will support in Go 1.19.
Therefore, some methods are implemented in function, and will release a new version according go 1.19 pre-release in 2022 later.
